#### -- Project Status: [Complete]

## Project Intro & Description
In this project, drug reviews for coumadin and warfarin are scraped off of druglib.com.  All of the data fields per review have been collected and put into the dataset. 
These reviews are then put through typical natural language text processing and side effects in the text are picked out and marked in the dataset.  A classification model was built using XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree and KNN.  Various topic modeling algorithms such as LDA, LSA and NMT were employed during the exploratory data analysis process.

The goal of the project is to be able to predict the most likely side effects for coumadin drug based on a drug taker's age, gender etc. and other related patient profile data.
